template-haskell-lens
=====================

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/template-haskell-lens.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-lens) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lens/template-haskell-lens.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/lens/template-haskell-lens)

This library defines `Lens`es, `Prism`s, and `Traversal`s built on top of the
API exposed by the `template-haskell` library. Be aware that the
`template-haskell` API is prone to frequent breaking changes, and since this
library mirrors the API exposed by `template-haskell`, this means that the API
in this library can change at a similar pace.

This package was split off from the `Language.Haskell.TH.Lens` module that used
to exist in the [`lens`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens)
package prior to version 4.18.
